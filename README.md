Hi, 
I hope you are doing well. 

For whomever it is reading this, on this repository you will find a personal project.
This is a robust but scalable employee database that allows users/companies to perform CRUDS operations on its employees by
using tools such as Angular, GraphQL, Node.js, Express, MongoDB, JWT, VCS & Heroku/Vercel to host it online. 
Below you will find the online links to the frontend & backend deployed through vercel & the test info to try it on your own machine. 
I hope you enjoy trying it. 

Thank you, 
Diego Plata.
